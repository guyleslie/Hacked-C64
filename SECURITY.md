# Security Policy

## Project Scope

This project targets the Commodore 64 using the Oscar64 cross-assembler. It is a retro, non-networked application, so traditional software security risks (such as remote exploits, data leaks, or network vulnerabilities) are not relevant.

## Bug and Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a bug, crash, memory corruption, or any unexpected behavior, please open a GitHub Issue in this repository with a clear description and, if possible, steps to reproduce the problem.

There is no formal security update process. All reports will be reviewed as time permits, and fixes may be provided in future releases if appropriate.

## Supported Versions

All released versions are considered community-supported. There is no official security support lifecycle.
