# Main changes summary

#### 1. **Improved Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) logic**
- In map_generation.c, room connections now use an enhanced MST algorithm that prevents duplicate connections.
- The previous iterative and fallback logic has been replaced with a simpler, more efficient algorithm that creates only the necessary connections and avoids redundant links.

#### 2. **Prevention of duplicate connections**
- A new function, `is_room_reachable` (DFS-based reachability check), has been added to rule_based_connection_system.c and declared in mapgen_internal.h.
- This function checks if two rooms are already reachable through existing connections, preventing unnecessary corridors.

#### 3. **Room management optimization**
- In room_management.c, room placement, validation, and priority handling have been optimized for the C64, using faster and more memory-efficient algorithms.
- Room placement is now grid-based, with multiple attempts and randomization for better distribution.

#### 4. **Comments and documentation**
- More detailed English comments have been added throughout the code, explaining C64 optimizations and Oscar64 compatibility.

#### 5. **Header file updates**
- New function declarations have been added to mapgen_internal.h, such as `is_room_reachable`.

### Example details from the diffs

- **map_generation.c**: Room connections now only create the shortest valid links and exit if none are found, avoiding unnecessary attempts.
- **rule_based_connection_system.c**: New DFS-based reachability logic prevents duplicate corridors.
- **room_management.c**: Room placement, validation, and priority assignment are now more efficient and use randomization.
- **mapgen_internal.h**: New function declarations and improved documentation.
