# Hacked-C64

Advanced Dungeon Map Generator for Commodore 64 – Implemented with Oscar64

## Overview

This project is a sophisticated dungeon map generator written entirely in C and optimized for the Oscar64 cross-assembler. The program generates complex, interconnected dungeon layouts with rooms, corridors, walls, stairs, and doors using advanced algorithms including Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for room connections and sophisticated corner detection. Features include real-time navigation, interactive map exploration, compact 3-bit tile encoding, and C64 PRG map export functionality. All code is heavily optimized for C64 hardware constraints with static memory allocation and direct screen memory access.

## Map Data Structure

The map is represented as a 2D grid of tiles, with each tile encoded using 3 bits for compact storage. The map dimensions are defined as 64x64 tiles (MAP_W x MAP_H). Each tile can represent different features such as empty space, wall, floor, door, stairs, or corner.

### Tile Types and Encoding

| Tile Type      | Symbol Name | PETSCII Code | PETSCII Character  | Description         |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Empty space    | EMPTY       | 32           | (space)            | Blank/empty tile    |
| Wall           | WALL        | 160          |' █ '               | Solid block         |
| Corner         | CORNER      | 230          |' ▓ '               | Shaded block/corner |
| Floor (path)   | FLOOR       | 46           |' . '               | Walkable path       |
| Door           | DOOR        | 171          |' + ' (invers char) | Door                |
| Stairs up      | UP          | 60           |' < '               | Up stairs           |
| Stairs down    | DOWN        | 62           |' > '               | Down stairs         |

*Note: The door is displayed as an inverse plus (+) character, PETSCII code 171.*

- **`RetroDebugger/**`**: Fully configured debugging environment for immediate use

### Quality Assurance

- **Automated Testing**: Each build is automatically tested for basic functionality
