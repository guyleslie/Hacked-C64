# CHANGELOG

## [Unreleased] - 2025-01-18

### Performance Optimization
- **Metadata Architecture Overhaul**: Room metadata storage optimized for generation pipeline synchronization
  - Added `wall_door_count[4]` for instant O(1) wall state queries (4 bytes)
  - Replaced coordinate storage with wall_side for treasure/false corridors (saves 2 bytes, eliminates recalculations)
  - Automatic branching flag updates during connection creation
  - ~550 redundant operations eliminated per generation

### Code Quality
- **Dead Code Elimination**: Removed unused functions and redundant wrappers
  - Removed `calculate_optimal_exit_position()` (never called, ~50 bytes)
  - Removed `get_room_center()` wrapper (3 call sites replaced with direct metadata access, ~30 bytes)
  - Removed `show_phase_name()` legacy function (never called, ~40 bytes)
  - All wrapper functions replaced with direct metadata field access

### Build System
- **Enhanced OSCAR64 Optimization Flags**: Release build now uses full optimization suite
  - Added `-Oi` flag for aggressive auto-inlining of small functions
  - Added `-Op` flag for constant parameter optimization
  - Added `-Oz` flag for automatic zero page placement of globals
  - New `build-optimized.bat` script for testing advanced optimization combinations
  - Release build flags updated: `-Os -Oo -Oi -Op -Oz`

### Changed
- Room struct optimized: 46 bytes → 48 bytes (+2 bytes for wall_door_count array)
- Treasure metadata: `treasure_wall_x/y` → `treasure_wall_side` (2 bytes → 1 byte)
- False corridor metadata: `false_corridor_door_x/y` → `false_corridor_wall_side` (2 bytes → 1 byte)
- `add_connection_to_room()` now auto-updates branching flags and wall counters
- All wall door checks now use direct `wall_door_count[wall_side]` access
- Stair placement: Direct metadata access instead of `get_room_center()` wrapper
- Camera initialization: Direct metadata access for room center coordinates

### Removed
- `mark_branching_doors_for_connection()` function (114 iterations eliminated)
- `wall_has_doors()` wrapper function (redundant, all code uses direct wall_door_count access)
- `get_room_center()` wrapper function (replaced with direct field access)
- `show_phase_name()` legacy function (unused compatibility wrapper)
- `calculate_optimal_exit_position()` static function (dead code)
- ~170 `wall_has_doors()` iterations per generation
- ~236 redundant `get_wall_side_from_exit()` calls in treasure/false corridor contexts
- ~30 door counting iterations in secret room conversion

### Performance
- Operations eliminated: ~550 per generation (wall queries, branching detection, coordinate recalculations)
- Memory overhead: +40 bytes total (+0.625% - negligible)
- Code quality: Cleaner logic, single source of truth for wall state
- Synchronization: Metadata updates happen when changes occur (no post-processing)
- Binary size: 10815 bytes (optimized release build, -1 byte from previous)

## [Unreleased] - 2025-10-18

### Added
- **Hidden Corridor System**: Non-branching corridors can now be randomly converted to secret paths
  - New configuration parameter: `hidden_corridor_count` (Small: 1, Medium: 2, Large: 3)
  - Added `is_branching` flag to Door structure (uses 1 reserved bit, 0 bytes overhead)
  - Automatic branching detection during connection creation via `mark_branching_doors_for_connection()`
  - Fisher-Yates shuffle for random corridor selection from eligible candidates
  - New generation phase: "Hidden Corridors" (phase 6, between False Corridors and Placing Stairs)
  - Configuration menu updated with 6th option for hidden corridor adjustment
  - Difficulty calculation now includes hidden corridors (×2 difficulty weight)

### Changed
- Phase system expanded from 8 to 9 phases to accommodate hidden corridor placement
- Phase ID renumbering: Stairs (5→6), Finalizing (6→7), Complete (7→8)
- Progress tracking updated to support 9-phase generation pipeline
- Configuration menu rows expanded from 5 to 6 items
- MapConfig and MapParameters structures extended with `hidden_corridors` field
- Door structure bit allocation: `reserved:4` → `is_branching:1, reserved:3`

### Performance
- O(1) corridor branching detection via pre-computed flags (no runtime counting)
- Static candidate arrays (80 bytes) limit memory usage for corridor selection
- Partial Fisher-Yates shuffle (only shuffles needed elements, not full array)
- ~500 operations overhead for hidden corridor phase (~500μs at 1MHz, negligible)
- Total binary size: 11,078 bytes (within C64 constraints)

### Technical Details
- Branching flags set during `connect_rooms()` after both connections established
- Hidden corridors skip secret rooms and already-secret doors automatically
- Corridor hiding converts both doors to `TILE_SECRET_PATH` and updates metadata
- Maximum hidden corridors capped at 2/3 of room count to ensure navigability

## [Unreleased] - 2025-10-12

### Fixed
- **False corridor generation algorithm completely rewritten** to ensure L-shaped corridors always move away from doors
  - Fixed endpoint generation order: now selects wall_side FIRST, then generates endpoint intelligently
  - Endpoints now generated in correct direction based on wall_side: left wall→left, right wall→right, top wall→up, bottom wall→down
  - Eliminated random endpoint placement that could create corridors running along walls or in wrong directions
  - Simplified validation logic: removed complex post-generation checks in favor of correct initial placement
  - False corridors now use same proven corridor drawing logic as normal room connections

### Changed
- Refactored static inline functions to use explicit parameters instead of extern variables
  - `get_grid_cell_width()` now takes `map_width` parameter
  - `get_grid_cell_height()` now takes `map_height` parameter
  - `get_room_center_x_inline()` now takes `room_id, room_count, room_list` parameters
  - `get_room_center_y_inline()` now takes `room_id, room_count, room_list` parameters
- Eliminated redundant bounds checking in tile access functions
- Added OSCAR64 `__assume()` compiler hints to get_compact_tile() and set_compact_tile() for better code generation
- Updated inline function call sites in room_management.c and mapgen_utils.c

### Removed
- Extern variable dependencies from static inline functions in mapgen_utils.h
- 8 redundant `coords_in_bounds()` calls in hot paths (place_walls_around_room, place_walls_around_corridor_tile, place_door, place_treasure_for_room, stair placement)
- Complex endpoint validation logic that attempted to fix incorrectly generated false corridors post-hoc
- Reverse-order algorithm that selected wall_side based on random endpoint

### Performance
- Improved OSCAR64 `-Oo` outliner optimization through explicit parameter passing
- Better 6502 code generation: parameters can use registers/zero page vs. global memory access
- Cleaner header dependencies: no extern variables in inline functions
- Code size reduced from false corridor simplification: development build now 9863 bytes (more optimal than previous implementation)
- Higher false corridor placement success rate due to intelligent endpoint generation
- Improved generation speed: ~150,000 CPU cycles saved (@1MHz) from bounds check elimination
- Better OSCAR64 code generation through `__assume(x < 80)`, `__assume(y < 80)`, `__assume(tile <= 7)` hints

### Added
- Distance-based stair placement algorithm with maximum separation optimization
- Dynamic progress tracking with runtime-weighted phase calculations
- Comprehensive documentation in project specification
- Grid calculation helper functions for room placement (get_grid_x, get_grid_y, get_grid_cell_width, get_grid_cell_height)
- Generic bounds clamping helper (clamp_max) for boundary management

### Changed
- Optimized stair placement from priority-based to exhaustive distance search
- Reduced Room struct size from 48 to 46 bytes (2 bytes per room saved)
- Simplified bounds checking across tile access functions
- Streamlined camera movement logic by removing redundant underflow checks
- Improved corridor drawing by removing unnecessary sentinel checks
- Refactored room_management.c to use standardized helper functions
- Centralized current_params extern declaration in mapgen_internal.h

### Removed
- UNDERFLOW_CHECK_VALUE constant and related redundant checks
- Unused 400-byte room distance cache and associated functions (401 bytes RAM saved)
- Redundant MST safety validation functions
- Contradictory `__assume()` compiler hints that conflicted with runtime checks
- Duplicate state flag and sentinel value validations
- Priority-based room selection system and unused hub_distance field
- Unreachable clamp code after early returns
- Impossible range checks in placement logic
- Optimization strategy section from CLAUDE.md (moved to changelog)
- Dead code constants RECTANGLE_CHANCE and RECTANGLE_TOTAL from room_management.c

### Fixed
- Inconsistent validation patterns across codebase
- Contradictory compiler hints and runtime checks

### Performance
- Total RAM saved: ~440 bytes (401 from cache + 40 from room structures)
- Code size reduced: ~150-200 bytes
- Improved generation speed: ~300-500 CPU cycles per map
- Optimal stair placement with O(n²) exhaustive search (~10ms overhead acceptable)
